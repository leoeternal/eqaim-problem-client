Highlights - 

1. The UI is exactly equal to the UI mentioned on the FIGMA page.
2. User will get all the errors warning under input fields and also if the output is fetched successfully then user will get a success notification.
3. I have used 'useReducer' hook and 'useContext' hook to manage the states in proper and an efficient way.
4. I have used 'styled components' to add styling.
